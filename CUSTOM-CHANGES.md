# Custom Changes Overview

## Primary Custom Change

- Updated the article retrieval logic to use the SEO-friendly URL slug generated by Kontent.ai instead of the database ID in 'Article.tsx' and 'Articles.tsx'
      - The updated logic includes updating the URL slug to the correct language if the user changes the language while on an article's page

## Smaller Custom Changes

- Removed the 'partnerCafe' code in 'Cafes.tsx' since filtering and displaying the cafes separately was no longer needed
- Gave the new article a real title (not lorem ipsum) so it could be translated into a Spanish version
- Used a slightly darker blue for the main menu/navigation bar than the provided screenshot to pass the WCAG AAA guidelines for color contrast
- Updated the hover background color on the navigation buttons to the other blue used on the site (instead of red) to make the UI more cohesive
- Added a gray hover background color for the 'article-tile-image' class to improve the user experience
- Moved the header to the top and added a new custom logo with a small animation to improve the look of the site
